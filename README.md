**xmdoc** module for [XOOPS CMS](https://xoops.org) is a documents management module.

This module is initially complementary to the modules of the xm-modules series. In fact, associated with these, it will allow you to add documents to your articles (xmnews module) and to your static pages (xmcontent module). It is possible to integrate into any module! To do this, just follow the tutorial on https://www.monxoops.fr.

Here are some interesting elements of the module:

    Fine management of rights by user groups, for each category (Access, Suggest, Edit and Approve, Delete)
    Anti-leeching filter possible with list of authorized sites
    Possible limitation of the number of downloads for each file in 24 hours per user
    Choice of authorized extensions (from a list> 100)
    Multi-languages FR GB/US
